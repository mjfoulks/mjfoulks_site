From Hampton Roads VA, MJ Foulks has lived a life immersed in ideas; ideas about the world, the power of stories, and the magic that can only be found in your imagination. She is a mother, wife, and friend. A dreamer by nature and a writer by trade, MJ has been spinning the web of Akelian (and other yarns) since 1985.
