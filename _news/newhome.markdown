## I take my work _very_ seriously. 

It's a 6 book fantasy series that I've been working on for 20 years and I'm very protective of it. Akelian is a place with dozens and dozens of ways to lose yourself, and it's more important now than ever to have a good book to lose yourself in. I've been escaping to Akelian for the last 20 years and where it's been a consistent source of magic and wonder. Now, I want to share my world and I don't know how best to get it out there. This is an idea that I feel is so in depth, that I, personally, don't feel like I can do this all by myself.


I'm doing my best with this, because I love this story.


## The Tip of the Iceberg
The prologue (Tales from the Elvish Realms) has potential (it needs to be edited and re-released, I know), but what no-one has had the chance to see yet is the rest of the world of magic and intrigue that I've built on top of that mythology.


## Bottom Line

I'm looking for an agent to help me pull the "Legends of Akelian" series (6 books + the prologue) out of my brain and _**put it out there**_
