# Chapter 1: Prologue

A violent past.  An uncertain Future.
But at present, peace...a tense peace, one that only few want.  

Getting along has never been easy for the humans and elves of Akelian.  Even their first ever encounter with each other was one fraught with tension and suspicion.  Though the leaders of these two grand races did their best to forge an alliance, it was in vain. 
Some say it was human greed; other say it was elvish righteousness.  Whatever the truth, whispers of hatred became rumors of impropriety.  The rumors spread, sprawling like a parasitic vine on the diseased truth.  

“The elves are hiding the key to immortality.”
“The humans have no respect for this world.”
“The elves want humans to suffer.”
“The humans will destroy all of Akelian.”

The rumors were too many, and too entangled to be pulled from the truth.  Suddenly, the opinion died alongside nuance.  A line had been drawn, and every citizen was on one side of that line or the other.  No exceptions. No gray areas.  No nuance.   
It was only a matter of time before the First War was declared, a war justified by both sides as a virtuous battle for the land of Evanesca.  Over time, the war cost many lives both elvish and human alike, leaving entire communities reeling from the death and destruction.  
A particularly horrible battle cost the humans their claim to Evanesca, as well as their king.  Though the elves had heavy casualties, the human armies stood no chance against what the humans called “Elvish Magic.”  Even in small numbers, the elves managed to reclaim Evanesca, to save it, as they said, from its impending destruction by human kind.  
But the three grand leaders of the Elvish Race, the Saints of Lumaneire, felt a sense of pity for the humans. A meeting of diplomacy was called for the leaders of all of Akelian’s realms.  In attendance were the High Priests of the Elvish Realms: 

    Rhodarion, a southern jungle 
    Mer Anemos, a bay in the southeast
    Solaurhia, an eastern grassland; 
    Aleodyn, a northern forest high atop a cliff
    Lumaneire, a holy land with no physical presence in Akelian

After the loss of Evanesca and their King, the humans sent the fallen king’s cousin Taremus, the next in line for the throne, to represent Bellumor Kingdom in the west, the only human realm left in all of Akelian.       
 After much negotiation, the Taremus and Miradel Peace Treaty was written and signed.
A Golden Age of Akelian followed, where the human kingdom and elvish realms were open and welcoming to all.  Journeys were traveled, cultures were shared, gifts were exchanged, and minds were opened.  But above all, humans and elves had finally let their guard down, had begun to trust one another...
But it was not meant to last.
An affair was exposed between the two most powerful leaders at the time, the very two that had signed the treaty that had brought peace.  
With the shock of this controversy, everything changed.  Old religious texts were cited, condemning the affair as an act against nature and an utter betrayal of the trust of the people.  Many humans began to question the motive behind the creation of the TAMP treaty, and began to question the moral authority of their leaders.  
Then, when the anger boiled over, the humans laid siege to their own king’s castle in a violent battle, one where the castle's own soldiers had turned their backs on the Royal Crown, one where both signers of the treaty were found within the castle walls in their nightclothes:  proof of an unholy union.  
 King Taremus and Saint Miradel, the highest leaders in all of Akelian, were executed for their crimes.  
Outrage and pain struck the elves, who cried out from their realms at the loss of their beloved leader.  They demanded justice and retribution.  War threatened to take over the world once again. 
Akelian's remaining leadership met with urgency for discussion and debate, a debate that went on for days and days, poking and prodding every possible angle, desperately trying to avoid more bloodshed.   
After careful thought to both the present anger and the safety of the future, the TAMP treaty was declared intact.  The usurping of King Taremus was declared the will of Bellumor’s own people, and Saint Miradel was within the human realm, at the mercy of their customs. No violations of the treaty had been made. 
So it was declared.  So it was done. The final word on the matter.  The people were to continue to go about their lives as if nothing had ever happened.  
Akelian moved on.  
And yet, the anger and hurt, the betrayal and pain, it all remained in the hearts of humans and elves alike, bleeding into the next generation, then the next, until it became an innate and inescapable part of life within these realms.  
Akelian was "at peace," but not because it wanted to be.  
Leaders of Akelian say little, and do even less. Desperately clinging to the Golden age, these powerful leaders have largely hidden in the shadows, governing from behind a veil.  The people are left to adapt to ever-changing policies and laws, all in the name of upholding a peace treaty that, many of its citizens believe, was shattered long ago...
