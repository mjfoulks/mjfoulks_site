A cloud of doubt casts a long shadow across the land of Akelian. The divine kingdom of Bellumor is in turmoil as they crack down on elven sympathizers who threaten to overthrow the very religion that underpins their society. Meanwhile, the elves of Akelian defend their borders against the ever present threat of human expansion to protect the delicate natural balance that has existed since the dawn of time. Clueless, Dmitri and Darion find a wounded elf near their isolated forest home. The only guarantee this omen brings is adventure.
